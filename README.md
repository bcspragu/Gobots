Okay, I've done some stuff. I decided that I'm going to go with Protobufs and
gRPC (sorry Ross) for the data model and server communication things, but
virtually nothing useful exists yet. I was strongly considering Cap'n Proto,
but it ended up looking far too daunting to pick up in a few minutes, so I'm
sticking with what I (almost kinda) know. I'm not sleep-deprived or utterly
useless yet, so might as well get some productive work in bootstrapping the
application.
