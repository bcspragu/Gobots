-Implement new flow [In Progress]
-Add methods for even easier usage of AI package [In Progress]

-Move 3rd party things to third_party
-Handle disconnect error cases better
-Add in support for guard, functions like RobotGame in Python
-Finish adding BotName as a part of the credential check
-Make tokens per user, not per bot
-See if aiFactory can be simplified

New Flow:

1. User registers username and is given unique token (NOT BASED ON THEIR NAME)
  a. User is instructed not to lose the token, because they canâ€™t get it back
2. User creates bot, implementing Action(board, bot) 
3. User calls StartRobotServer(name, token, aiFactory)

New flow doesn't involve GitHub, usernames are first come, first serve, users
can be limited to a certain number of bots, probably 10
